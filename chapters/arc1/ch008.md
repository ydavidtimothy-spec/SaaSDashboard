# Chapter 8 — "Academic Weapon"

---

The midterms were approaching, and the DCNHS campus was thick with the scent of panic.

Art students are notoriously bad at traditional academics. It’s not that we’re stupid; it’s just that when you spend six hours a day practicing scales or painting still lifes, quadratic equations feel like a personal insult from the universe.

"I'm going to fail Math," Jose, the nervous choir boy, whispered to me during lunch. He was looking at his textbook like it was a bomb defusal manual. "If I fail Math, I get probation. If I get probation, no choir. If no choir, I die."

"You won't die, Jose," I said, calmly eating my *monggo*.

"I will! My mom will kill me! She thinks being a musician is a waste of time. If I fail Algebra, she'll make me shift to Engineering!"

I looked at the problem he was struggling with. Polynomials.

"Here," I said, pulling his notebook towards me. "Think of it like music theory."

"Music theory is harder than math," he argued.

"Exactly. If you can understand a Neapolitan Sixth chord, you can understand *X*."

I scribbled a quick explanation. I didn't use the textbook method. I used the 'Real World' method—the mental shortcuts I'd learned doing my own taxes and helping my mom with her small loans.

"X is just the root note," I said. "The other numbers are just the intervals. You're just transposing the equation."

Jose stared at the paper. Then at me.

"Oh."

"See?"

"Uncle David," he whispered reverently. "You're a genius."

"I'm not a genius, Jose. I'm just old."

"What?"

"Old soul. I meant old soul."

The day of the exams came.

The classroom was silent except for the scratching of pens and the collective sound of forty teenagers questioning their life choices.

Mrs. Fernandez walked up and down the aisles, watching for cheaters.

I breezed through the History test in twenty minutes. It was unfair, really. One of the essay questions was about the *Edsa Revolution*. I didn't just know the facts; I remembered the documentaries vividly from my adult life. I wrote with a perspective that no seventeen-year-old should have—nuanced, cynical, yet hopeful.

Math was next. Then Science.

I finished them all with time to spare.

While my classmates were sweating bullets, chewing their pencils, and praying to saints they hadn't spoken to in years, I was looking out the window, composing a melody in my head.

*Re... Fa... Sol...*

"Mr. Yoro?"

Mrs. Fernandez was standing by my desk. "Are you sleeping?"

"No, Ma'am. Just thinking."

"You have thirty minutes left. Are you sure you're done?"

"I checked it twice, Ma'am."

She picked up my test paper, scanning it skeptically. Her eyebrows shot up. She flipped to the back page. Then she looked at me with a mixture of suspicion and awe.

"You can go," she said quietly.

I packed my bag and walked out. I could feel sixty eyes burning into my back.

*He's a witch,* the eyes said. *Burn him.*

"Did you cheat?"

Rafe caught me by the vending machine later that afternoon. He was drinking a Gatorade, looking exhausted.

"Hello to you too, Rafe," I said, inserting a coin. "And no, I didn't cheat."

"You finished the Math exam in thirty minutes. Even I took the full hour, and I have a tutor."

"Maybe your tutor should teach you how to simplify fractions instead of just *Nessun Dorma*."

Rafe grunted. "Funny. Seriously, though. How?"

I retrieved my can of cheap soda.

"I pay attention," I lied. "And I don't panic. Panic makes you stupid."

Rafe leaned against the machine. For all his glorious talent, he looked like a normal, stressed kid right now.

"I need to pass Science," he muttered. "My dad said if I get anything lower than an 85, he's pulling me out of the showcase."

"Harsh."

"Asian parents, man. 'You want to sing? Fine. But you better be a scientist too'."

He looked at me. The Golden Boy, asking for help again.

"Uncle," he said, using the nickname that was unfortunately sticking. "Tutoring session? Tonight? I'll buy dinner."

I sighed.

"Fine. But not tonight. I'm going home to Mandug for the weekend."

"Mandug? That's far."

"It's home. Sunday afternoon. Meet me at the library."

"Deal."

He walked away, looking relieved.

I watched him go. It was strange. In my first life, Rafe was the villain. The rival I couldn't touch. But up close? He was just a kid under immense pressure, trying to keep everyone happy.

"Maybe he's not the enemy," I mused. "Just... the final boss."

The results were posted three days later.

**Class Ranking (Academics)**

1.  **YORO, David** - Average: 98.4
2.  **MONTOYA, Rafael** - Average: 92.1 (After our study session)
3.  **ARAGON, Isabella** - Average: 91.5
...

The whispers started immediately.

"The vocal rankings were a fluke."

"He's an academic scholar in disguise."

"He's definitely 30 years old. I bet he has a mortgage."

Cel cornered me at the lockers.

"Rank 1," she said, her eyes narrowing. "In Academics. You're gunning for Valedictorian?"

"I'm gunning for the stipend, Cel," I said, opening my locker. "The scholarship requires good grades."

"You're changing the hierarchy," she warned. "Rafe is supposed to be Number 1. Bella Number 2. I'm Number 3. You're messing up the ecosystem."

"Ecosystems adapt," I said, grabbing my History book. "Or they die."

I closed the locker.

"Besides," I added, "Rafe doesn't mind. I helped him pass Science."

Cel's jaw dropped. "You... helped him?"

"We have a trade agreement."

"You're trading with the enemy?!"

"I'm engaging in diplomacy," I corrected. "Try it sometime. It's less exhausting than plotting."

I walked away, leaving her fuming.

As I headed to choir rehearsal, I saw Rafe down the hall. He saw the ranking sheet. He saw me.

He didn't scowl. He didn't look threatened.

He gave me a little salute. A calm, respectful acknowledgement.

*Game recognize game.*

I smiled.

Rank 1 in Academics. Rank 14 in Vocals.

The Suzuki was upgrading its engine.
