# Chapter 6 — "The Kids These Days"

---

High school cafeterias are sociological experiments designed by sadists.

You have the popular table (Rafe and the choir royalty), the gamers (arguing about patches), the study grinders (shoving rice into their mouths while reading photocopied notes), and the floaters.

I was technically sitting with the "Rising Stars"—Cel, Maya, and Ken—but mentally, I was calculating my monthly budget.

"So," Cel said, leaning forward. Her voice dropped to theatrically conspiratorial volume. "Have you heard about Rafe's private tutor?"

"No," I said, chewing a piece of tough pork chop. "Is he good?"

"Good? He's Maestro Alcantara. The one who trained the Madrigal Singers."

"Impressive."

"It's unfair, really," Cel continued, her eyes sharp. "The rest of us are stuck with the school curriculum, and Rafe is getting conservatory-level coaching on weekends. Don't you think it's unfair, David?"

She was fishing. She wanted me to agree, to express jealousy, to form an alliance of the "oppressed talented" against the "privileged elite."

"Life is unfair," I said, wiping my mouth with a tissue. "Some people are born rich. Some people are born with perfect pitch. Some people are born looking like Rafe."

"And?"

"And complaining about the weather doesn't stop the rain," I said. "If he has a Maestro, good for him. I have a mirror and a metronome. They're cheaper."

Cel blinked. She looked like a cat that had pounced on a laser pointer only to realize it wasn't there.

"You're impossible," she muttered.

"I'm practical."

"Don't you want to beat him?"

"I want to get a scholarship," I corrected. "Beating him is just a side effect."

"That's the same thing!"

"No," I said, looking her in the eye. "One is an ego trip. The other is survival. Different motivations, different fuel."

Cel stared at me for a long moment. I could see the gears turning in her head. She was trying to classify me. Was I a rival? A tool? A harmless eccentric?

"You know," she said slowly, "Bella thinks you're faking it."

"Faking what?"

" The bad technique. She thinks you're sandbagging. Hiding your true power."

I laughed out loud. It was a genuine, hearty laugh.

"Trust me," I said, rubbing my sore abs (the planks were killing me). "If I could sing *'Nessun Dorma'* right now, I would be doing it from the rooftops. My technique is garbage, Cel. No conspiracy there."

"Then why...?"

"Why what?"

"Why are you so calm?" she whispered. "Everyone else is freaking out. Everyone is terrified of failing. But you... you eat your pork chop like you have all the time in the world."

I looked down at my empty plate.

*Time.*

That was the one thing I didn't have the first time. I was always rushing. Rushing to be famous. Rushing to be loved. Rushing to the bottom of a bottle.

"Panic burns energy," I said simply. "I need my energy for lip trills."

I stood up, picking up my tray.

"See you in class, ladies. Don't forget the carrots."

As I walked away, I heard Ken whisper to Cel.

"He's definitely an alien. Or a vampire."

"He's annoying," Cel replied, but there was no bite in it. Just confusion.

The afternoon session was Music Theory.

If Vocal Techniques was torture for the body, Music Theory was torture for the mind—for everyone else.

For me, it was relaxation.

"Who can identify this interval?" Mrs. Gomez played two notes on the piano.

Thirty hands shot up.

"Major Sixth!" Rafe shouted.

"Correct."

"This one?"

"Minor Third!" Bella called out.

"Correct."

"This chord?"

She played a complex, jazzy cluster.

The class hesitated. Rafe frowned. Bella tilted her head.

I raised my hand.

"Yes, Mr. Yoro?"

"Dominant 7th sharp 9," I said. "The 'Hendrix Chord'."

Mrs. Gomez raised her eyebrows. "Very good. You listen to jazz?"

"I listen to everything, Ma'am."

Rafe turned around in his seat. He looked... irritated.

"Show off," he mouthed.

I winked at him.

*Game on, kid.*

The rest of the class was a blur of circle-of-fifths and key signatures. I saw students sweating, erasing answers, panicking over simple modulations.

I sat back, sketching a budget plan in the margin of my notebook.

*Allowance: P100/day*
*Transport: P20*
*Lunch: P40*
*Savings: P40*
*Goal: Buy a decent voice recorder.*

I needed to record my practice sessions. The Nokia 3310 had a voice recorder, but the quality was like listening to a choir underwater.

"David," Rafe said as the bell rang.

I looked up. The Prince was standing at my desk.

"Yeah?"

"You're good at theory."

"I have ears."

"My theory grade is... okay," he admitted, looking pained. "But chords confuse me. All the extensions."

"It's just math, Rafe. Emotional math."

He hesitated. The Golden Boy was about to ask a favor.

"Do you... want to study together? For the midterms?"

I looked at him.

This was Rafe. The guy who, in my first life, had ignored me until I dropped out. The guy who went on to become a national star while I sang in smoky bars.

And here he was, asking for help with chord extensions.

"Sure," I said. "But it'll cost you."

"Cost me?" He looked offended. "I have money."

"I don't want money."

"Then what?"

"Your tutor," I said. "Maestro Alcantara. What does he tell you about breath support?"

Rafe blinked. "He... helps me visualize."

"Share the visualization," I said. "And I'll explain the Hendrix Chord."

Rafe grinned. It was the first improved smile I'd seen from him—not the stage smile, but a real, co-conspirator grin.

"Deal. Uncle."

He walked away, high-fiving his friends.

I packed my bag.

Information trade. An alliance with the top dog. Not bad for day two.

Cel was watching from the doorway. She looked furious. She'd been trying to recruit me to her 'underdog' faction, and I'd just signed a non-aggression pact with the enemy.

I gave her a little wave.

*Sorry, Cel. Politics is for kids. Adults do business.*
