# Chapter 3 — "Rank F"

---

The hallway leading to the administration bulletin board was a war zone of pheromones and anxiety.

It was the morning after the auditions. The list was up.

Dozens of aspiring artists were crowded around the corkboard, a crush of bodies that smelled of fabric softener, nervous sweat, and too much cologne. There were screams of joy, quiet sobs of devastation, and the aggressive silence of those pretending they didn’t care.

I stood at the back of the crowd, sipping a lukewarm magnificent 3-in-1 coffee from a plastic cup.

"Excuse me," a girl with a violin case murmured, trying to squeeze past.

"Go ahead," I said, stepping aside.

I checked my watch. 8:15 AM.

In my previous life, I would have been right there in the front row, elbows out, desperate to see my name. I would have felt that tightening in my chest, the nausea of uncertainty.

Now? I just felt… patient.

When you’ve waited twenty years for a second chance, waiting ten minutes for a crowd to disperse is nothing.

"Oh my God! I got in! I got in!"

"Rank 28… shit, is that waitlisted?"

"Who’s Number 1? Of course. It’s him."

The crowd eventually thinned out as the bell for the first period approached. I walked up to the board, my steps leisurely.

The list was printed on plain bond paper, pinned haphazardly at the corners.

**DCNHS - SCHOOL FOR THE ARTS**
**Music Department (Vocal) - Admission Results**

1.  **MONTOYA, Rafael** - 98.5%
2.  **ARAGON, Isabella** - 97.0%
3.  **PAGTALUNAN, Maricel** - 94.2%
4.  **SANTOS, Jose** - 91.5%
...

I scanned down the list. My finger traced the names past the Top 5, past the Top 10.

Ah. There I was.

**14. YORO, David - 76.5%**

"Fourteenth," I whispered, taking a sip of my coffee. "Generous."

Honestly, I expected lower. Based on yesterday’s performance—the lack of breath support, the non-existent resonance, the mosquito-like volume—I would have given myself a barely passing 75. Professor Villanueva must have bumped me up for the diction.

"Fourteenth place. Not bad for a walk-in."

I turned.

Standing a few feet away was Maricel "Cel" Pagtalunan. She was smiling, that practiced, politician’s smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. She had a list of her own in her hand, probably organizing a study group or a social clique already.

"I’m Cel," she said, extending a hand. "Mezzo. Rank 3."

"David," I said, shaking it. Her grip was firm, professional. "Tenor. Rank 14."

"I heard you in the audition," she said, her head tilting slightly. "Your Italian was amazing. Where did you study?"

"YouTube," I lied again.

"YouTube?" Her smile faltered for a microsecond before reassembling. "Wow. That’s resourceful. We should practice together sometime. The diction coach is scary, maybe you can help us."

*And so it begins,* I thought. *Asset acquisition.*

In my first life, I’d been flattered by Cel’s attention. I’d thought she was just friendly. It took me two years to realize she only befriended people she could use—or people she needed to keep an eye on.

"Sure," I said, giving her a bland non-committal nod. "If I survive the technical drills."

She laughed, a tinkling sound. "Oh, you will. See you in class, David."

She walked away, already scanning the hallway for her next target.

I turned back to the board.

Above the list was a smaller flyer, bright yellow and aggressive.

**FULL SCHOLARSHIP GRANT**
**Criteria:**
1. Maintain Rank 1 in Department for 2 consecutive quarters.
2. impeccable disciplinary record.
3. Faculty recommendation.
**Benefits:**

- Free Instrument Maintenance/Voice Therapy
- Board & Lodging Subsistence

I stared at the "P5,000" figure.

In 2017, five thousand pesos was a fortune for a high schooler. For my family, it was the difference between *sinangag* with *tuyo* and *sinangag* with actual meat. It was the difference between Mama working overtime every night and Mama coming home for dinner.

"Daddy needs the money," I muttered.

Rank 14 to Rank 1.

I looked up at the top name again. **Rafael Montoya.**

He was the Chosen One. The Ferrari engine in a Ferrari chassis. Beating him in two quarters?

It was impossible.

Statistically, physically, logically impossible.

But I had something Rafe didn't have.

I checked my Nokia phone. 8:25 AM. Class started in 5 minutes.

I downed the rest of my coffee and crumpled the cup.

Rafe had talent. Bella had pedigree. Cel had connections.

I had the script.

"Time to go to work," I said to the empty hallway.

***

The first homeroom class was exactly as chaotic as I remembered.

Thirty art students in one room is a recipe for sensory overload. The dancers were stretching in the aisles. The visual artists were sketching on the desks (vandalism, technically, but they called it 'expression'). The musicians were drumming on every available surface.

I found a seat in the back row, near the window. The protagonist seat.

"Is this seat taken?"

I looked up.

It was Bella. Isabella Aragon.

She wasn't looking at me. She was looking at the empty desk, her expression one of mild distaste, as if the desk had personally offended her ancestors.

"No," I said. "It's free."

She sat down, placing her bag on the floor with precise movements. She took out a notebook, a pen, and a bottle of expensive mineral water. She didn't say thank you. She didn't introduce herself. She didn't acknowledge my existence.

*The Ice Queen cometh,* I thought.

In the front row, Rafe was holding court. He was sitting on top of a desk—classic popular kid move—surrounded by a group of laughing admirers. He was telling a story, using his hands for emphasis, his voice projecting effortlessly over the classroom noise.

"...so I told the conductor, 'Sir, if you want it faster, you conduct it faster!'"

Laughter erupted.

I leaned back in my chair, crossing my arms.

Rank 14.

I closed my eyes and listened.

I could hear the breathiness in the girl laughing to my left. *Nodule warning.*
I could hear the tension in the guy shouting across the room. *Laryngeal strain.*
I could hear the perfect resonance in Rafe's laughter. *Clean placement.*

I wasn't just observing them. I was diagnosing them.

I was a mechanic in a room full of race car drivers who didn't know how to change their own oil.

"Class! Settle down!"

The adviser walked in. Mrs. Fernandez. I remembered her. She taught History, but she had a soft spot for the artists.

"Welcome to Grade 11," she said, placing her chalk on the desk. "This is the start of your journey. Some of you are here because you have talent. Some of you are here because you have potential. And some of you..."

She scanned the room, her eyes lingering on the troublemakers from last year.

"...are here because your parents didn't know what else to do with you."

Nervous laughter.

"But in this school," Mrs. Fernandez continued, "talent is cheap. Discipline is the currency. You want to be artists? Prove it."

I smiled.

*Discipline.*

That was my game now.

I opened my notebook—a cheap, spiral-bound thing I'd bought at the wet market—and wrote down a single line at the top of the first page.

*Goal: Breach Top 10 by Midterms.*

It was a modest goal. Realistic.

I looked at Rafe's back.

*Then, we hunt the Prince.*

"Hey," Bella whispered.

I blinked. She was speaking to me?

"You're the one who sang *Caro Mio Ben* yesterday."

"Yes."

"You were flat on the E4," she said, without looking at me. "And your breath support is terrible."

"I know," I said cheerfully.

She finally turned to look at me, blinking in confusion. She expected me to get defensive. To make an excuse.

"You know?" she asked.

"I have the lung capacity of a hamster," I quoted Professor Villanueva. "Working on it."

She stared at me for moment, searching for... what? Arrogance? Insecurity?

She found neither. Just a thirty-seven-year-old man's indifference to the opinions of a teenager.

"Strange," she murmured, turning back to the front.

I smirked and looked out the window.

Rank 14. Rank F.

The bottom of the food chain.

Perfect.

Nowhere to go but up.
