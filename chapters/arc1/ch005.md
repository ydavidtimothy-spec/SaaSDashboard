# Chapter 5 — "First Day Blues"

---

The alarm clock on my Nokia 3310 went off at 5:00 AM. A shrill, monophonic beep that could pierce the soul.

I slapped it off, rolled out of bed, and felt... fine.

No back pain. No hangover headache. No crushing existential dread about bills.

"Being seventeen is a cheat code," I muttered, stretching my arms. My joints didn't even crack.

I walked to the kitchen. Lola was already there, frying *danggit*.

"Agay, early bird," she noted, surprised. "Usually I have to drag you out of bed by the ear."

"New leaf, Lola. New leaf."

I grabbed the broom and started sweeping the floor. It was instinct. In my thirties, a messy floor meant cockroaches, and cockroaches meant calling the exterminator, which cost money I didn't have.

Lola stopped frying. She stared at me, spatula in hand.

"Are you possessed?" she asked seriously. "Did a *duwende* replace my grandson?"

"Just doing my part," I said, sweeping a dust bunny into the pan.

"Elena!" Lola shouted towards the bedroom. "Come look! Your son is cleaning! Voluntarily!"

Mama walked out, looking disheveled and tired. She blinked at me, then at the broom.

"Did you break something?" she asked suspiciously.

"I'm just sweeping!"

"If you need money for a project, just ask," she yawned, pouring coffee.

I sighed. My past reputation was truly a heavy cross to bear.

***

The jeepney ride to school was a sensory assault.

Overloaded passengers. The roar of the diesel engine. The driver blasting 80s love songs at a volume that violated the Geneva Convention.

I sat near the entrance, gripping the metal rail. Across from me, two students from a nearby private school were talking about *Mobile Legends* (which I realized didn't exist yet... wait, what were they playing? *Clash of Clans*? No, it was 2017. *Mobile Legends* was just starting to blow up).

"Bro, my Hanabi is insane," one kid said.

"Trash pick," the other sneered. "Tank main for life."

I smiled nostalgically. I used to be that kid. Obsessed with games, thinking rank mattered.

"Bayad po," I said, handing my coins to the driver. "Isa. Student."

"Saan?"

"DCNHS."

The driver glanced at me in the rearview mirror. "Artist ka, boy?"

"Trying to be, Manong."

"Good. Don't do drugs."

"Noted."

I got off at the school gate, adjusting my backpack. It felt unnaturally light. In my previous life, my bag was filled with bills, medications, and regret. Now, it just held notebooks and a packed lunch.

Technical High School life commenced.

The first subject was English. The teacher, Mr. Tan, was a young, enthusiastic guy who clearly wanted to be the "cool teacher".

"Okay class!" he clapped his hands. "Today we're going to talk about *poetry*. Who here thinks poetry is boring?"

Half the class raised their hands.

"Honesty! I like it. But poetry is just... lyrics without the beat. It's rap without the flow. It's—"

He was trying so hard. I felt a wave of second-hand embarrassment.

To make matters worse, the class was chaotic. People were passing notes. Someone was eating chips under their desk. The subtle hum of teenage hormones was palpable.

I found myself getting annoyed. Not as a student, but as an adult.

*Shut up and listen,* I wanted to yell. *He's trying to teach you something.*

"Excuse me," I whispered to the guy next to me. He was tapping his pen against the desk, a rhythmic *click-click-click* that was driving me insane.

"What?" he snapped.

"Could you stop?" I said, using my 'Customer Service Voice'—the one I developed working at a call center for three years. "It's distracting."

The guy blinked. "Uh... sure?"

He stopped. He looked weirded out.

"Thanks."

I turned back to the front. Mr. Tan was reciting *Invictus*.

*"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul..."*

Standard high school stuff. But the line hit me differently now.

I looked at my hand. Smooth skin. No calluses. No tremors.

I really was the captain now. And I had to steer this ship away from the iceberg I knew was coming.

"Mr. Yoro?"

I looked up. Mr. Tan was staring at me.

"Yes, Sir?"

"You look very intense. Do you have a thought on the poem?"

"It's about stoicism," I stood up. My voice was calm, projected well (habit). "Henley wrote it while recovering from a tubercular infection that cost him his leg. It's not just about being strong. It's about refusing to let suffering define your identity. It's about maintaining agency in a chaotic world."

Silence.

Mr. Tan's jaw dropped slightly. The chip-eating kid stopped chewing.

"Uh... yes," Mr. Tan said, adjusting his glasses. "That is... extremely insightful. Did you read the study guide?"

"Life is the study guide, Sir," I said, and immediately regretted it.

*Too deep. Too dad-joke. Abort.*

I sat down.

"Okay..." Mr. Tan cleared his throat. "Moving on."

I felt a poke on my shoulder.

It was Cel. She was sitting behind me.

"You speak like a textbook," she whispered, her eyes amused. "Are you secretly thirty years old?"

I froze.

"Haha," I laughed drily. "Good one."

*She knows too much. Must eliminate.*

"You're weird, David," she decided. "I like it. Wanna eat lunch with us?"

I looked at her. 'Us' probably meant her expanding circle of influence. Potentially useful.

"Sure," I said. "Why not."

***

Lunch was a battlefield. The canteen was a humid, noisy tin can packed with five hundred hungry teenagers.

I sat with Cel and two other girls—a dancer named Maya and a visual artist named Ken (yes, a girl named Ken).

"So, David," Cel said, opening her bento box (which looked frighteningly healthy). "What's your deal? You walk like a principal, talk like a professor, and sing like... well, like you have technique but no air."

"I'm an old soul," I said, unwrapping my *adobo* and rice.

"Rafe thinks you're hilarious," Cel added casually.

"Rafe talks about me?"

"He calls you 'Uncle'."

I choked on my rice.

"Uncle?"

"Yeah. He says you have 'Uncle Energy'. Like, you're just done with everyone's sh*t."

Maya giggled. "It's true though. When that guy was tapping his pen, I saw your face. You looked like you wanted to ground him."

"He was disrupting the learning environment," I defended.

"See!" Ken pointed her fork at me. "Who says 'learning environment'? Just say he was being annoying!"

I sighed. "Okay. Fine. I have Uncle Energy. I accept it."

"So, Uncle David," Cel leaned in, her eyes glinting. "What's your strategy for the scholarship?"

The table went quiet. The S-word.

"Scholarship?" I feigned ignorance. "I'm Rank 14, Cel. I'm just trying not to fail."

"Please," she scoffed. "Villanueva spent ten minutes roasting you yesterday, but he didn't kick you out. He *loves* you. He usually kicks the Suzukis out on day one."

She was sharp. Dangerous.

"I'm just doing the drills," I said neutrally. "Planking. Lip trills. Breathing."

"Boring," Maya said.

"Effective," I countered.

"Well," Cel said, spearing a piece of broccoli. "Just so you know, Rafe is planning to perform *'La Donna è Mobile'* for the Freshman Showcase."

I paused. *'La Donna è Mobile'*. The Duke's aria. flashy, high B naturals, crowd-pleaser.

"Ambitious," I said.

"He'll nail it," Cel said. "And Bella is doing *'O Mio Babbino Caro'*. Everyone is bringing big guns."

"And you?" I asked.

"Me?" Cel smiled. "I'm doing a folk song. Keep everyone guessing."

Smart. She knew she couldn't out-power Rafe or Bella, so she was going for charm.

"What about you, Uncle?" Ken asked. "What are you singing for the Showcase?"

"I don't know," I said honestly. "Villanueva banned me from singing."

"What??"

"Banned. Embargoed. Silent mode."

They stared at me in horror. For a music student, being banned from singing was like a chef being banned from the kitchen.

"So you're just going to... stand there?"

"I'm going to build my chassis," I said, taking a bite of adobo. "And when the ban is lifted... well, we'll see."

I looked across the cafeteria. I saw Rafe at the "cool table," laughing loudly, throwing a grape into his mouth. He looked radiant. Untouchable.

Enjoy the spotlight, kid. I'm busy fixing the engine.

"By the way," I said, turning back to the girls. "You shouldn't eat that broccoli, Cel. It causes gas. Bad for breath support."

Cel froze, her fork halfway to her mouth.

"Oh my god," she whispered. "You really are a dad."

I smirked. "Eat your carrots. Good for the eyes."
