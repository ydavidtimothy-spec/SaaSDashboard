# Chapter 7 — "Ensemble Rehearsal"

---

The DCNHS Chorale was the pride of the school. They won regional competitions, toured nationally, and wore uniforms that cost more than my entire wardrobe.

Joining the ensemble wasn't a choice; it was mandatory for all vocal majors.

"Tenors, back row! Sopranos, front left! Altos, right! Basses... do we even have basses?"

Mr. Ledesma, the choir director, was a chaotic ball of energy. He was younger than Villanueva, maybe in his late thirties, with wild hair and a habit of conducting with his entire body.

"We have two basses, Sir!" a tall, lanky kid shouted.

"Two? God help us. Okay, baritones, cover the lower harmony. Rafe, you're Tenor Section Leader. Fix them."

Rafe stood up, radiating authority. It was annoying how natural he looked in charge.

"Tenors, listen up," Rafe said, clapping his hands. "I don't want to hear any straining today. Open throats. Support."

I sat in the very last row, next to a guy named Jose who was vibrating with nervousness.

"I'm scared," Jose whispered. "Ledesma throws scores if you're flat."

"Just listen to the person next to you," I advised. "If you can hear your own voice over the person next to you, you're too loud."

"Really?"

"Choir 101. Blend before power."

Mr. Ledesma raised his hands. The room went silent.

"Warm-up first. *Ma-me-mi-mo-mu*. Going up by semitones."

The piano struck a chord.

*"Ma-me-mi-mo-mu..."*

The sound was... overwhelming.

Thirty untrained or semi-trained voices hitting the air at once. It was loud. It was enthusiastic. And it was messy.

The sopranos were screeching the high notes. The tenors were shouting to be heard. The altos were drowning in the texture.

I opened my mouth, but I didn't sing. I just shaped the vowels.

*Lip sync battle: Opera Edition.*

Technically, Villanueva banned me from singing. But I couldn't just stand there like a statue in choir. So I produced the tiniest, lightest sound possible—a thread of tone that barely vibrated my vocal cords.

*Focus on the ears,* I told myself. *Listen to the chord.*

I tuned into the chaotic soup of sound. Rafe was cutting through the texture with a bright, ringing tone. Too bright for a choir, honestly. He sounded like a soloist surrounded by backup singers.

"Stop! Stop!"

Ledesma waved his armsfrantically.

"Tenors! You sound like a pack of wolves fighting over a carcass! Blend! Listen to each other!"

He glared at Rafe.

"Rafe, you're sticking out."

Rafe blinked, surprised. "I'm projecting, Sir."

"You're dominating. This isn't the 'Rafe Montoya Show'. It's a choir. Who is singing the third?"

Silence.

"I need more third! Someone fix the chord!"

They started again.

This time, I added a little more weight. Just a gram. I found the third of the chord—the note that gives the harmony its color—and I placed it gently in the gap between Rafe's root and the altos' fifth.

I didn't push. I just... existed in the frequency.

It was like parking a car into a tight spot. *Click.*

"Better!" Ledesma shouted. "There! Who was that? Someone anchored the harmony!"

He scanned the tenor section. His eyes swept past Rafe, past the straining boys in the middle, and landed on the back row.

"You. New guy. What's your name?"

"David, Sir."

"Sing that phrase again. Alone."

My heart skipped a beat. *Banned. Embargoed.*

"I... currently have a vocal restriction from Professor Villanueva, Sir."

Ledesma rolled his eyes. "Of course. Dante and his restrictions. Fine. Hum it."

I hummed the note. A clean, vibrato-less F-sharp.

"See?" Ledesma pointed at me. "That tone. It's boring. It's plain. It has no ego. That is a choral tone! Rafe, copy him."

Rafe turned around, his jaw practically hitting the floor.

"Copy... him?"

"Yes. Less 'Pavarotti', more... whatever David is doing. Again!"

We sang the chord again. Rafe, to his credit, adjusted immediately. He dialled back the vibrato, darkened his tone, and matched my pitch.

The chord locking into place was a physical sensation. The beat frequencies disappeared. The wall of sound became a single pillar.

"Yes!" Ledesma jumped in the air. "Music! Finally!"

He looked at me with a newfound respect.

"David, move to the middle. Next to Rafe."

"Sir?"

"I need an anchor. You're the anchor. Move."

I picked up my bag and shuffled to the center of the row, sitting next to the Prince.

Rafe looked at me sideways.

"How did you do that?" he whispered.

"Do what?"

"You barely made a sound, but you changed the whole chord."

"It's not about volume, Rafe," I whispered back, quoting a conductor I'd worked with in 2025. "A choir is like a salad. You're the tomato. You're bright and tasty. But you need lettuce to make it a salad. I'm the lettuce."

Rafe frowned. "I don't get your metaphors."

"Just sing softer. And listen to the basses."

"Basses? They're weak."

"That's why you listen to them. If you can't hear them, you're too loud."

Rafe paused. He looked at the basses, then back at me.

"Okay. Lettuce. Got it."

The rehearsal continued. For two hours, we drilled *'Rosas Pandan'* and *'Anima Christi'*.

By the end, I was exhausted. Not vocally—I'd barely used my cords—but mentally. Active listening is harder than singing. You have to be constantly adjusting, micro-tuning, calculating the acoustics of the room.

But as we packed up, I felt a strange sense of satisfaction.

In my first life, I hated choir. I thought it was suppressed my solo potential. I thought blending was for people who couldn't stand out.

I was an idiot.

Choir was the ultimate discipline. It was the art of controlling your ego for the sake of the collective sound.

"Hey," Rafe said as we walked out.

"Yeah?"

"That was... actually better. The chord felt easier to hold."

"Physics," I said. "Constructive interference. When we lock in, the sound amplifies itself. You don't have to work as hard."

Rafe shook his head. "You know a lot of weird stuff for a beginner."

"I read a lot."

"Right. The 'YouTube' thing." He didn't look convinced.

As we reached the gate, a black sedan pulled up. A uniformed driver stepped out.

"That's my ride," Rafe said. "You taking the jeep?"

"Yeah."

He hesitated. "Do you... want a lift? If you live near downtown?"

The offer hung in the air. Rafe Montoya, offering a ride to the weird transfer student. This was definitely a deviation from the original timeline.

"Thanks," I said, pointing to the jeepney stop where a crowd was already forming. "But I like the fresh air. And the carbon monoxide."

Rafe laughed. "Suit yourself. See you tomorrow, Lettuce."

He got in the car.

I watched him drive away, AC running, tinted windows up.

Then I walked to the jeepney stop, squeezed myself between a construction worker and a lady carrying two baskets of fish, and paid my seven pesos.

It was hot. It was cramped. It smelled like sweat and diesel.

But as the jeepney rattled forward, I hummed the tenor line of *'Anima Christi'*.

Softly. Perfectly in tune.

Rank 14 was starting to find his rhythm.
