# Chapter 4 — "Building the Chassis"

---

Being a thirty-seven-year-old in a high school classroom is a surreal experience.

It’s like playing a video game on New Game+ mode, where you keep all your stats and items but the enemies are still Level 1.

"Okay class, who can tell me the significance of the Treaty of Paris?"

Mrs. Fernandez looked around the room. Most of the students were avoiding eye contact, praying to the gods of invisibility.

I raised my hand. Languidly.

"Mr. Yoro?"

"It ended the Spanish-American War in 1898," I recited, leaning my chin on my hand. "Spain ceded the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico to the United States for twenty million dollars. Basically, we were sold for the price of a mid-tier NBA player's contract."

The class blinked. Mrs. Fernandez blinked.

"That... is correct. And a very cynical interpretation. Very good."

I suppressed a yawn.

Academic subjects were a breeze. I’d lived through the history, done the math (taxes are a great algebra teacher), and spoken the English for decades. The challenge wasn't the difficulty; it was the boredom.

But I wasn't here for History or Algebra.

I checked the schedule taped to my notebook.

**1:00 PM - Major Subject: Vocal Techniques I**
**Instructor: Prof. Dante Villanueva**

The main event.

***

Professor Villanueva’s studio was legendary.

It wasn't a classroom. It was a dungeon disguised as a music room. Soundproofed walls, a grand piano that cost more than my house, and mirrors. Mirrors everywhere.

"Posture," he barked before we even walked through the door.

He was standing at the entrance, holding a long wooden stick like a conductor's baton—or a weapon.

"Shoulders down. Chest open. Neck free. If I see you slouching, you’re out."

The thirty of us straightened up instantly. Even Rafe, who usually walked with a casual slouch, snapped to attention.

We filed in. The air in the room was different—heavier, serious. This was where the dream started or died.

"Welcome to Vocal Techniques," Villanueva said, walking to the piano. "Forget everything you think you know about singing. Forget *American Idol*. Forget *The Voice*. Forget your karaoke high scores."

He sat down and played a dissonant chord.

"Here, you are not stars. You are instruments. And right now, most of you are out of tune, poorly maintained, and broken."

He looked directly at me.

"Mr. Yoro. Front and center."

I stepped forward. I could feel Rafe’s eyes on my back. Bella was watching me with clinical interest.

"You have a fascinating voice, Mr. Yoro," Villanueva said, his voice deceptively soft. "Do you know why?"

"Because it sounds like an old man?" I suggested.

A few students giggled. Villanueva didn't smile.

"Because it is a lie," he said.

The room went silent.

"Your diction says you are a master. Your phrasing says you are an artist. But your body?" He poked my stomach with the stick. "Your body says you are a couch potato."

"Ouch," I muttered. Accurate, though.

"Breathe for me," he ordered. "Deep breath."

I took a breath. I tried to expand my back, to lower my diaphragm. But the muscles were weak. They trembled under the effort.

"Pathetic," Villanueva declared. "Look at this. Shallow. Tension in the neck. Shoulders rising. We define this as 'clavicular breathing'. It is the breathing of a dying asthmatic, not a singer."

He turned to the class.

"Mr. Yoro is a perfect example of what happens when the mind is faster than the body. He tries to produce a sound that his physical instrument cannot support. It is like putting a Ferrari engine inside a Suzuki Every Wagon. If he steps on the gas... *boom*."

He mimicked an explosion with his hands.

"So, what do we do with a Suzuki?" he asked.

"Buy a new car?" Rafe piped up.

"No," Villanueva said, ignoring the laugh. "We reinforce the chassis."

He turned back to me.

"From today, you are forbidden to sing."

I blinked. "Sir?"

"No songs. No arias. No karaoke. Nothing."

"But... this is a singing class."

"For them," he gestured to the others. "They need to learn how to sing. You? You need to learn how to breathe. If you sing now, you will destroy your vocal cords in six months. You will develop nodules, you will hemorrhage, and you will be mute by eighteen."

He wasn't exaggerating. In my first life, that was exactly what happened. I pushed too hard, too fast. By the time I was twenty, I had nodes the size of grapes.

"So what do I do?" I asked.

"Lip trills," he said. "And planks. And breathing exercises."

"For how long?"

"Until I say you are ready."

He looked at me, challenging me to argue. To complain. To be the arrogant teenager who thought he knew better.

In my past life, I would have stormed out. I would have called him a hack. I would have said I didn't need this.

But I wasn't that kid anymore.

I looked at the mirror. I saw the skinny, slouching teenager with the weak chest. And I saw the thirty-seven-year-old failure hiding inside him.

"Understood," I said.

Villanueva raised an eyebrow. "No complaints? No 'but I want to sing'?"

"I love boring, Sir," I said, meeting his gaze. "Boring means stable. Boring means foundation."

A flicker of surprise crossed his face. He nodded slowly.

"Good. Then get on the floor."

"Excuse me?"

"Plank. 60 seconds. While doing a lip trill."

The class gasped. That was torture.

I didn't hesitate. I dropped to the floor, got into a plank position (my arms shook immediately), and started trilling my lips.

*Brrrrrrrrrr...*

It was humiliating. I was face down on the dusty floor, making motorboat noises while my classmates watched. My abs burned. My arms screamed.

But for the first time in twenty years, I felt something else.

Hope.

I wasn't just singing. I was building.

"Thirty seconds!" Villanueva shouted, pacing around me. "Keep the sound steady! Don't let the pitch drop!"

*Brrrrr-ugh-rrrrrrr...*

"Don't collapse, Yoro! Imagine you are a bridge! A bridge of steel!"

I grit my teeth. *I am a bridge. I am a damn suspension bridge.*

When he finally yelled "Time!", I collapsed onto the floor, gasping for air.

"Not bad," Villanueva grunted. "Tomorrow, we do two minutes."

I groaned into the floorboards.

As the class ended and everyone filed out, still whispering about the "crazy new guy," Villanueva stopped me.

"Most students want to fly immediately," he said, arranging his sheet music. "They want the applause, the flowers, the high notes. They don't want the sweat."

I picked up my bag, wiping the dust off my uniform.

"I know, Sir."

"You accepted the condition very quickly," he observed. "Why?"

I paused at the door. I looked back at the grand piano, at the mirrors, at the man who had tried to save me the first time, only I hadn't let him.

"I've flown before, Sir," I said quietly.

"Oh?"

"Yeah." I smiled, a dry, bitter smile that belonged to an older man. "The landing killed me."

Villanueva stared at me, his pen hovering over his grade book.

"Get out, Yoro," he said, but his voice lacked its usual bite. "See you tomorrow. Don't be late."

"Yes, Sir."

I walked out into the corridor. My body ached. My pride was bruised. I was officially the "Suzuki Kid" of the batch.

But as I walked towards the school gate, I felt lighter than I had in years.

The chassis was being built. And this time, it was going to hold the engine.
