## Phase 1: Awakening (Ch. 1)

### Chapter 1 — "The Uncle is a High Schooler"

**POV:** First Person (David)

**Opening Line Concept:**
> There are those days in life, aren’t there? Days when you’re inexplicably sick.

**Beat Structure:**
1. **The Wake** — David opens his eyes. Wrong ceiling. Wrong body. Wrong decade.
2. **The Realization** — Checks phone: Nokia 3310. It's 2017. He's 17.
3. **The Voice Test** — Bathroom concert. *'O Sole Mio*. Flawless diction, terrible stamina.
4. **The Critic** — Neighbor bangs on the wall. "Crazy bastard!" David accepts the review.
5. **The Choice** — "This time, I won't waste it."

**Micro-Memory (Distributed Backstory):**
> For a moment, I was thirty-five again, staring at the same mirror in a dingy apartment.
> I blinked. The apartment was gone. I was seventeen.

**End Hook:**
> Tomorrow was the SPA admission audition. The first crossroad where everything had started going wrong.

## Phase 2: The Audition (Ch. 2-4)

### Chapter 2 — "The Suzuki with a Ferrari Engine"

**POV:** First Person (David)

**Setting:** DCNHS-SPA audition hall

**Beat Structure:**
1. **The Stage** — Walking into the audition hall. It feels smaller.
2. **First Glimpse of Rivals** — Bella (Ice Queen), Cel (The Snake), Rafe (The Prince).
3. **The Performance** — David sings. Diction: 10/10. Breath: 2/10. 
4. **The Judges' Confusion** — "He sounds like a 40-year-old heavy smoker who swallowed a textbook."
5. **Prof. Villanueva's Interest** — "A monster trapped in a child's body."

**Technical Focus:**
- Explain breath support failure through sensation
- Show the gap between knowledge and physical capability

**End Hook:**
> One judge leaned forward. "That diction... where did you learn it?"
> I couldn't say: "Twenty years of karaoke and regret."

### Chapter 3 — "Rank F"

**POV:** Mixed (David + brief third-person reactions)

**Setting:** Results posting day

**Beat Structure:**
1. **The Wait** — Crowd gathered. Tension is palpable. David is bored.
2. **Results Revealed** — Rafe/Bella top the list. David: 14th.
3. **Rival Introductions:**
   - *Rafe* ignores him.
   - *Bella* dismisses him.
   - *Cel* smiles too vaguely.
4. **Internal Monologue** — "Fourteenth? Fair enough. I did sound like a dying goat at the end."
5. **The Goal** — Sees the 100% Scholarship. "Daddy needs the money."

**Micro-Memory:**
> In my first life, I laughed at scholarships. Now, I did the math on tuition fees and almost cried.

**End Hook:**
> 100%. Tuition, boarding, materials. I just had to beat everyone. Easy, right? (No).

### Chapter 4 — "Building the Chassis"

**POV:** First Person (David)

**Setting:** First day of classes / Professor Villanueva's studio

**Beat Structure:**
1. **Back to School** — David aces academic classes. Being an adult in 11th grade is cheating.
2. **First Vocal Lesson** — The moment of truth.
3. **The Diagnosis:**
   > "Your diction is extraordinary. Your breath support is catastrophic. You are a Ferrari engine in a Suzuki chassis."
4. **The Deal** — "I'll teach you foundation. It will be boring. It will be painful."
5. **The Acceptance** — "I love boring. Boring means stable."

**Technical Focus:**
- Explain 90% breath support deficit
- Introduce the "balanced vocalization" concept

**End Hook:**
> The Professor looked at me. "Most students want to fly immediately."
> "I've flown before, Sir. The landing killed me."
