# Chapter 1 — "Twenty Years in Thirty Seconds"

---

There are those days in life, aren’t there?

Days when you’re inexplicably sick.

Seemingly just a light flu, then suddenly your head is burning like it’s being grilled and your body goes limp, utterly powerless.

Having done nothing special the day before—not going out to cold places, not meeting anyone sick—and yet ending up bedridden. Those unlucky days.

I had that happen once. During my senior year of high school, right before the biggest audition of my life.

Perhaps because it was the day before admission, it was etched deeper into my memory.

"Hays… Who does this kid take after, that his body is so weak? Anyways Dav, I’ll leave the medicine here so you must take it regularly, okay? Mama has to go out for work. Call me if it gets worse!"

The warmth patting my head vanished and the voice got softer.

What…? I couldn’t understand the situation.

While trying to knead the bits and pieces of thoughts together, I feel back into sleep, unable to fight against the overwhelming exhaustion.

***

I cycled between sleeping and waking, battling the boiling heat and the aching body.

Mindless dreams merged here and there as the past reappeared like scattered illusions.

My mother, young and singing in her church choir. Me growing up watching that, humming along with a childish soprano. Me studying late for the admission test. The family, happy with me passing the written exam. The store attendant preparing the patched-up uniform. Friends looking down, angry expressions of teachers… and… the old faces of my parents.

Like bubbles rising to the surface, the painful school days filled my brain.

DCNHS - School for the Arts.

I had been accepted into that school, where the best prodigies gathered, by sheer luck.

Since I, who had no connections or impressive background, had been picked into the Vocal Music department which only had a handful of students, it was something worthy to be called a miracle.

In the year I applied, there was a strange lack of applications for the Advanced Classical sector, and since the school had to pick at least a certain number, they must’ve had to bite the bullet with me.

And finally, my skills were displayed in broad daylight, surrounded by condescending eyes.

I had no care for them.

Because I really loved music.

***

When I woke up with a start, I was on the bed.

Slowly turning my gaze, I could see the swaying curtains next to the window, through which a faint scenery was displayed—a scenery of old Quezon City apartments. The moonlight passed through the cheap fabric, shedding subtle light onto furniture inside the room.

Lifting my arm, I placed my hand on my forehead. The fever had considerably reduced.

"…"

I struggled to raise my upper body, and the room entered my eyes. Clothes rolling around the floor, a room I was not used to.

‘No, it feels like I’ve seen it somewhere before?’

With a frown, I thought for a bit, before deciding to search through the bed for my phone.

Here it was. A solid rectangle.

After somehow finding the phone, I lifted it and realized something was odd. Turning the phone upside down with trembling hands, the logo reflected the moonlight.

*Nokia 3310.*

"…"

There were too many problems.

First of all… this thing was a brick. This heaviness couldn’t be explained by my weak body. And, lo and behold, there were buttons—actual physical buttons!

Besides, even after bringing it close to my face, there was no touchscreen.

Is it a phone from 20 years ago or something?

‘Wait, 20 years?’

With a sudden realization, I opened the room door and staggered towards the toilet. The house was of an unfamiliar structure, yet my feet carried me forward on their own.

The toilet… is probably this way.

And when I reached the front of the mirror…

There was a young version of me. About 20 years younger.

It wasn’t easy to understand the situation, but it wasn’t impossible either. After struggling and turning on the astonishingly old-fashioned phone, I checked the calendar. 

**March 18, 2017.**


I had something none of the other students had: twenty years of hindsight. Twenty years of knowing exactly what mistakes to avoid, what techniques actually worked, what it really took to build a voice that could last a lifetime.

My body might be starting from zero, but my mind was starting from twenty years in the future.

The bathroom light buzzed overhead. The faucet continued its slow drip. Outside, Davao City was waking up—I could hear more roosters now, the distant sound of a motorela puttering down the street, the murmur of early morning voices from the neighbors.

I turned off the bathroom light and stepped out into the hallway.

The smell hit me first. *Sinangag*—garlic fried rice, the scent of toasted garlic filling the small house like a promise. And beyond that, the faint hint of *tuyo*, dried fish crisping in a pan. Smells I hadn't experienced in years, not really, not like this. My Manila apartment had never smelled like home.

Lola was in the kitchen when I walked in.

She looked up from the stove, and for a moment I couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. She was so much younger than I remembered—still straight-backed, still quick-moving, her gray hair pulled back in that familiar bun. Her eyes crinkled when she saw me.

"*Naunsa ka?*" she asked, a hint of concern in her Bisaya. "You look like you've seen a ghost, apo."

*I have,* I wanted to say. *I'm looking at one right now.*

Instead, I crossed the kitchen in three steps and wrapped my arms around her.

She was smaller than I remembered. Or maybe I'd just been too drunk, too self-absorbed, too far away to really notice. Her bones felt fragile beneath my arms, but her embrace was still strong—still that fierce, protective grip that had held me together when I was a child.

"*Unsa man ni?*" she laughed, patting my back. "Since when do you hug your Lola without being asked?"

*Since I missed twenty years of chances,* I thought. *Since I let you die without saying goodbye.*

"Nothing," I said, my voice muffled against her shoulder. "I just... I love you, Lola."

She pulled back to look at my face, her eyes suddenly sharp. "Are you sick? Should I call Gina?"

"No, I'm fine." I forced a smile. "Just... grateful. That's all."

She studied me for a long moment, and I saw something flicker in her eyes—not suspicion, but something like recognition. Like she was seeing something in me that hadn't been there before.

"You've changed," she said softly. "Something's different."

*Everything,* I wanted to say. *Everything is different.*

But instead I just smiled and helped her set the table, moving through the motions of a morning routine I'd thought I'd forgotten. The blue plastic plates. The mismatched glasses. The small jar of vinegar for the *tuyo*. Every detail was exactly as I remembered—and exactly as I'd stopped noticing, back when I was seventeen the first time and thought I had forever.

Mama came in as we were sitting down, still in her work clothes—she must have been getting ready for another early shift at the government office. She paused when she saw me already at the table.

"*Dali man ka?*" she asked. "You're up fast."

"Big day tomorrow," I said. "Wanted to get an early start."

She raised an eyebrow. "Since when do you prepare for things early?"

*Since I learned what happens when you don't.*

"Since now," I said.

We ate in relative silence—Mama was never talkative before coffee, and Lola was focused on making sure everyone's plate stayed full. The *sinangag* was perfect, each grain of rice separate and glistening with garlic. The *tuyo* was crispy and salty, exactly the way I'd craved it for twenty years in Manila, where nothing ever tasted quite the same.

I ate slowly. Deliberately. Tasting everything.

In my first life, I'd rushed through meals like they were obstacles between me and whatever I really wanted to do. I'd never stopped to appreciate the simple miracle of eating food prepared by people who loved me.

I wasn't going to make that mistake again.

After breakfast, Mama left for work with a quick "ingat" thrown over her shoulder. Lola started washing the dishes, waving off my offer to help. "Go practice," she said. "I heard you in the bathroom earlier. You need it."

I froze. "You heard—"

"These walls are thin, apo." She smiled without turning around. "Your voice isn't what it used to be."

*It never was,* I thought. *That's the problem.*

I retreated to my room and closed the door.

The room was exactly as I would have left it—if I'd left it this morning as a seventeen-year-old with no memory of the future. Scattered sheet music on the desk. A poster of Luciano Pavarotti on the wall (faded, one corner peeling). An old upright keyboard in the corner, the same one Lola had bought secondhand from a church that was upgrading.

I sat down on the edge of my bed and stared at my hands.

Tomorrow was the audition. The first crossroad where everything had started going wrong.

In my first life, I'd walked into that audition hall with nothing but raw talent and arrogance. I'd sung a piece that was too difficult for my level, chosen specifically to show off. I'd ignored the fundamentals, pushed through the passaggio instead of navigating it, sacrificed technique for drama.

The result had been a performance that impressed no one and convinced the judges I was exactly what I appeared to be: a talented boy with no discipline.

This time would be different.

I closed my eyes and began to catalog my assets and liabilities.

**Assets:**
- Twenty years of vocal knowledge, including techniques I'd only mastered in my thirties
- Perfect understanding of Italian diction and vowel modification
- Mature emotional interpretation (if I could control it)
- Adult discipline and patience
- Hindsight on every mistake I'd ever made

**Liabilities:**
- A seventeen-year-old body with zero physical development
- Catastrophic breath support (estimated 10% of eventual capacity)
- Unstable passaggio (completely uncontrolled)
- Weak diaphragm and intercostal muscles
- No established reputation

The math was simple. I had the software but not the hardware. The knowledge but not the instrument.

Most regression fantasies would have me dominating immediately—walking into that audition and blowing everyone away with my superior technique. But that was fiction. Reality was messier.

I couldn't sing like my thirty-seven-year-old self. That voice had been built on twenty years of physical development, twenty years of muscle memory, twenty years of conditioning. This body was starting from zero.

What I *could* do was train smarter. Avoid the mistakes. Build the foundation right the first time.

And tomorrow, at the audition?

I needed to be strategic. Not impressive—*strategic*.

Choose a simpler piece. Focus on what I could control: diction, musicality, emotional connection. Let the weaknesses hide behind strengths. Aim for "interesting potential" rather than "finished product."

In other words: do exactly the opposite of what I'd done the first time.

I stood up and walked to the keyboard. Pressed a key—middle C. The sound was slightly out of tune, as it had always been. But it was enough to give me a reference point.

"*Do...*"

The note came out thin. Breathy. I held it as long as I could, feeling my breath give out after barely five seconds.

Pathetic.

But that was okay. That was the starting point.

I had tomorrow to survive and a lifetime to rebuild.

The fluorescent light buzzed overhead. Outside my window, Davao City was fully awake now—jeepneys rumbling past, vendors calling out their wares, the distant bass thump of someone's videoke machine already testing the neighbors' patience.

I closed my eyes and began the first of ten thousand scales.

Tomorrow was the SPA admission audition. The first crossroad where everything had started going wrong.

This time, I was going to get it right.
