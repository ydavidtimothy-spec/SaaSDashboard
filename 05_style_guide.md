# Style Guide: Narrative & Voice

## Core Genres & Themes
**Genres**: Comedy, School Life, Seinen, Slice of Life
**Key Themes**:
*   **Protagonist Stats**: Calm, Confident, Determined, Hard-Working, Mature.
*   **Plot Elements**: Second Chance (Time Travel), Music/Singing, Past Plays a Big Role, Poor Protagonist.
*   **Tone**: A blend of *technical seriousness* (music) and *dry, dad-joke humor* (internal monologue). David thinks he's hilarious; his teenage peers are just confused.

## Core Narrative Voice (David / Yunjae)
The story is told in **First Person (David's POV)**. The voice is a specific blend of **experienced professional** and **struggling physical reality**.

### Key Characteristics
1.  **Analytical & Technical**: David analyzes everything—especially his own body and voice—with the precision of a veteran vocal coach. He doesn't just "fail to hit a note"; he explains *why* anatomically (larynx position, breath support, cord closure).
    *   *Example*: "Lowering the larynx and fiercely closing the vocal cords, raising the velum and forcing the diaphragm to increase the pressure."
2.  **Stoic & Pragmatic**: He acknowledges his pathetic state but doesn't wallow in self-pity for long. He quickly pivots to "What can I do with this?"
    *   *Example*: "‘Truly worthless.’ ... That didn’t matter. Because even so, I could still sing."
3.  **Contrast of Mind vs. Body**: Constantly highlight the disconnect between his 37-year-old virtuoso brain and his 17-year-old untrained body.
    *   *Example*: "The me right now was a conductor, an accompanist, a soloist and an audience member."
4.  **Short, Punchy Paragraphs**: Use frequent line breaks for emphasis. Many paragraphs should be single sentences.
    *   *Example*: 
        "There were too many problems."
        
        "First of all… the phone was extremely heavy."

### Formatting Standards
-   **Thoughts**: Use single checkmarks/quotes for internal monologue.
    *   *Format*: ‘No, It feels like I’ve seen it somewhere before?’
-   **Lyrics**:
    *   Original language (Italian/etc.) in quotes.
    *   Translation immediately following in `[Square Brackets]`.
    *   *Example*:
        "Che bel-la cosa, e’na jurnata ‘e sole-"
        [A beautiful day with the dazzling sun]
-   **Sound Effects/Vocalization**: Write out scales or vocal sounds textually.
    *   *Example*: "Ah ah ah ah ah -"
-   **Time Transitions**: Use `*` or `***` for scene breaks.

## Scene Structure: The "David" Formula
1.  **Sensory Awakening**: Start scenes with strong physical sensations (heat, sound, smell).
2.  **Confusion -> Deduction**: David observes details (phone model, calendar, mirror) to deduce his situation logically.
3.  **Technical Assessment**: He tests his instrument (voice). This is a detailed, step-by-step process.
4.  **Performance**: He sings/acts despite limitations. Use musical metaphors (conductor, audience).
5.  **Reality Check**: End with a grounding moment (neighbor yelling, mom calling) to cut the tension with humor or realism.

## Tone Examples (Do vs. Don't)
*   **DO**: "The warmth patting my head vanished and the voice got softer. What…? I couldn’t understand the situation." (Immediate sensory focus)
*   **DON'T**: "I woke up feeling sick and confused about where I was." (Too generic)

*   **DO**: "As a habit, I started scaling. From C3 to C4. Do re mi fa so la ti do." (Show the professional habit)
*   **DON'T**: "I tried to sing some scales to test my voice." (Telling, not showing action)

*   **DO**: "The magnificent ringing had degraded to a deflating balloon..." (Vivid metaphor)
*   **DON'T**: "My voice sounded bad and weak." (Bland)
