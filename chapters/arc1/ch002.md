# Chapter 2 — "The Suzuki with a Ferrari Engine"

---

The Davao City National High School - School for the Arts (DCNHS-SPA) audition hall was smaller than I remembered.

In my memories—and perhaps in the exaggerated lens of nostalgia—this place had been a coliseum. A grand arena where dreams were forged or shattered. Now, standing at the entrance with a number pinned to my chest (Candidate #14), it looked like what it was: a repurposed multi-purpose hall with peeling paint and an air conditioner that rattled like a dying tractor.

"Candidate Number 13! Next is Number 14!"

The student volunteer at the door shouted with enough enthusiasm to wake the dead. I winced. Why did teenagers have to be so loud?

Wait. I was a teenager too. Technically.

"Relax, kuya," a girl next to me whispered. "You look like you're going to a funeral."

I turned to see a girl with wide eyes and braces, clutching a flute case like it was a lifeline.

"Not a funeral," I corrected, adjusting my collar. "Just an execution. Probably mine."

She giggled nervously. Kids these days. They thought anxiety was cute. I knew it as a prelude to bills and taxes.

I scanned the holding room. It was a sea of nervous energy. Vocalists were doing lip trills in corners. Dancers were stretching in ways that made my phantom back pain flare up just watching them. Instrumentalists were tuning their violins, creating a discordant symphony of *A-440*.

And then there were *them*.

Every shonen anime has them. The rivals. The prodigies. The ones who make the protagonist realize their power level is garbage.

Sitting in the front row, back straight as a ruler, was a girl who looked like she’d been carved out of porcelain. Isabella "Bella" Aragon. Even from here, I could see the focused intensity in her posture. She wasn't looking at anyone. She was staring at the stage door, probably visualizing her victory speech.

To her left, chatting up a storm with three different people at once, was Maricel "Cel" Pagtalunan. She was smiling, nodding, laughing at jokes that definitely weren't funny. The Politician. In my first life, she’d charmed her way into student council, every major solo, and eventually, a scholarship to a conservatory in Manila. She wasn't the best singer, but she was the best *player*.

And then, in the center of the room, surrounded by a small gravitational field of admirers…

Rafael "Rafe" Montoya.

He looked... young. That was the first thought that hit me. In my memory, Rafe was this looming giant of talent, the guy who always cast a shadow over me. Now? He was just a kid with good hair and a confident smirk.

He was laughing at something his friend said, a carefree, easy sound. The sound of someone who has never cracked on a high note in front of five hundred people.

God, I hated him. (Affectionately. Mostly).

"Number 14! David Yoro!"

The volunteer's voice cut through my inspection.

"Here," I said, raising my hand.

I walked toward the double doors. As I passed Rafe, he glanced up. Our eyes met for a split second. He looked bored. Dismissive. Like I was just another NPC in his main character journey.

*Enjoy it while it lasts, kid,* I thought. *The tutorial is over.*

I pushed open the doors and stepped into the audition hall.

***

The panel of judges sat behind a long table draped in a blue cloth. In the center sat the man who would become the bane of my existence for the next two years: Professor Dante Villanueva.

He looked exactly the same. The man clearly didn't age; he just accumulated more disapproving frown lines. He was reviewing my application form, likely noting the complete lack of formal training or impressive pedigree.

"David Yoro," he read, not looking up. "Seventeen years old. No previous vocal coach?"

"No, sir."

"Self-taught?"

"You could say that." *If you count twenty years of failing in karaoke bars and cheap gigs as 'self-teaching',* I added silently.

"Repertoire?"

" *'Caro Mio Ben'*, by Giuseppe Giordani."

The other two judges exchanged a look. It was the quintessential beginner piece. The 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' of classical voice. Safe. Boring. Expected.

Professor Villanueva finally looked up. His eyes behind his wire-rimmed glasses were sharp, assessing. "Go ahead. Whenever you're ready."

I nodded to the accompanist. She gave me a bored look and played the opening chord.

*Deep breath.*

Except, it wasn't deep.

My body instinctively tried to expand the lower ribs, to drop the diaphragm, to engage the intercostals for that solid column of air I was used to. But the muscles... just weren't there.

It felt like trying to rev a Ferrari engine inside a Suzuki hatchback. The intent was powerful, but the chassis rattled and groaned under the pressure.

I opened my mouth.

*"Caro mio ben..."*

The sound that came out was... thin.

It lacked the rich, chesty resonance I was used to. It was a boy's voice. A light, undeveloped tenor with no bottom end.

But the *words*.

I shaped the vowels with the precision of a surgeon. The *C* was crisp, originating from the hard palate. The *a* was bright but covered, not the flat, spread 'a' of a typical Filipino accent. The *o* was round, dark, a perfect sphere of sound.

*"Credimi almen, senza di te..."*

*Support! Support, damn you!*

I mentally screamed at my diaphragm. It fluttered uselessly. My breath was running out. I was halfway through the phrase and my tank was already flashing red.

In my thirties, I could hold this phrase for days. I could go out for coffee, come back, and still be holding it. Now? I was gasping like a fish on dry land.

I had to compensate. I used every trick in the book. I lightened the tone to save air. I modified the vowels to be more closed, requiring less pressure. I cheated the tempo, pushing the phrase forward just a hair to reach the end before I collapsed.

*"Languisce il cor..."*

I cut the final note short. Cleaner to end early than to wobble and die.

Silence.

The accompanist stopped playing. The room was deathly quiet.

I stood there, trying not to pant visibly. My chest was heaving. My legs felt like jelly. I had sweated through my shirt in less than two minutes.

*Pathetic,* I thought. *Absolutely pathetic. I sound like a dying goat with good pronunciation.*

I prepared myself for the criticism. *'Next.' 'Work on your breath.' 'Come back next year.'*

"Where did you learn Italian?"

The voice didn't come from Professor Villanueva. It came from the female judge on the left, her eyebrows raised so high they were in danger of merging with her hairline.

"I... studied, ma'am," I lied smoothly. "Listening to recordings."

"Recordings?" She looked skeptical. "Your diction is... excessively precise. You pronounce the double consonants like a native. *'Freddo'*, *'Senza'*. Most students slur those."

"I have good ears," I said.

Professor Villanueva leaned forward, clasping his hands. He hadn't written a single thing on my evaluation sheet.

"Your breath support," he said, his voice deep and gravelly, "is nonexistent. You have the lung capacity of a hamster."

I winced. "I know, sir."

"And yet," he continued, narrowing his eyes, "you navigated the phrase breaks like an old pro. You knew exactly when you were running out of air and adjusted the vowel weight to compensate. A beginner would have pushed and cracked. You... retreated."

He paused, tapping his pen on the table.

"It was a terrible performance," he said bluntly.

"Thank you, sir."

"But it was a fascinatingly *intelligent* terrible performance."

He scribbled something on the paper. A single word. I couldn't see what it was, but the scratch of the pen sounded loud in the quiet hall.

"It's like someone took a professional opera singer, drained all his blood, and forced him to run a marathon," he muttered, mostly to himself. "A monster trapped in a child's body."

"Sir?"

"Nothing," he dismissed me with a wave of his hand. "Next candidate."

I bowed—a proper stage bow, waist at 45 degrees, head down—and walked off.

As I exited the stage door, I let out the breath I felt like I'd been holding since 2037. My hands were shaking. Not from nerves, but from physical exhaustion. Singing one song had winded me more than a 5k run.

"Hey," a voice called out.

I looked up. It was Rafe. He was standing by the water cooler, looking me up and down with a mix of confusion and... something else. Amusement?

"I heard you in there," he said. The walls were thin. "You sounded..."

He struggled for the right word.

"Like an old man?" I suggested.

He laughed. It was a bright, charismatic sound that made me want to punch him and buy him a beer at the same time.

"I was going to say 'weird'," Rafe grinned. "But yeah. Old man works too. Nice Italian, though. Uncle."

He clapped me on the shoulder and walked past me toward the stage door.

"Number 15! Rafael Montoya!"

I watched him go. The confidence. The swagger. The terrifyingly infinite potential of youth.

I leaned against the wall and closed my eyes, listening as the first notes of Rafe's audition piece drifted through the door. *'Nessun Dorma'*. The ambitious bastard was singing *'Nessun Dorma'*.

And the worst part?

He was hitting the notes. With power. With ease. With the kind of raw, reckless energy I would kill to have back.

"Uncle," I muttered to myself, testing the word.

I looked down at my shaking hands, then at the Nokia 3310 in my pocket.

Professor Villanueva was right. I was a monster. A breath-starved, muscle-atrophied, time-traveling monster.

But monsters had one advantage over prodigies.

We knew how to survive in the dark.

I pushed off the wall and headed for the exit. One step at a time. One breath at a time. The Ferrari engine was there. I just had to build the car around it before I exploded.
